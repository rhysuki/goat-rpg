the goat is called nier for clarity's sake

Nier is in her house. She needs to
She needs to venture past the forest to grab a stick of butter sitting
in the forest pedestal to make cookies.
	Her roommate, watching tv on the couch, is like, "hey can you go to
	the forest to grab the butter."

The forest has a bunch of contraptions locking 3 big doors. She has to
venture into 3 areas and solve a puzzle to unlock one of the doors.

The butter is directly past the doors, so once you finish the puzzles
you can just go and grab it and come back.

Nier comes back home with the butter and they make cookies. the end

Nier is in the house. She needs to venture past the forest to fix an
artifact that breaks every once in a while and supplies the house with,
like, power or something.

Her roommate is like "hey can you go fix the artifact, be sure to grab
the toolbox behind the house on the way there" and that's like the first
thing you do before going.

Nier goes and does the puzzles and fixes the artifact. By the time she's
done, it's already nighttime. She comes back home and realised she spent
the entire day to do a single task that wasn't even that hard to begin
with. Like an allegory for executive dysfunction?
